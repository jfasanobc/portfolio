# Portfolio - Single Page Application  
A portfolio project with React, Webpack, Docker, and other things.  


Description
====
This project is to show off some of the lessons from setting up a proper environment using npm, react, webpack, docker, jest, and eventually other technologies. Using both production and development evironments with many of these technologies, as well as proper bundling for deployment to a live environment.

## List of commands  (Run within root folder)  

***npm init:dev***  
 - This will run all npm installs needed for root folder and both client and server directories for local development setups  

***npm init:prod***  
 - This will run all npm installs needed for deployment in a production environment  

***npm run dev***  
 - This will launch the Webpack dev server to localhost:3000  
 - The dev server has hot modules enabled and editing anything in /src will result in the page refreshing  

***NPMHOST=[example.test] npm run dev***  
 - This is optional, example syntax: `NPMHOST=example.test npm run dev`
 - Including a [hostname] will launch the Webpack dev server with the desired hostname in the browser if wanted.  
 - The inclusion of a hostname implys that your DNS is properly configured for that hostname and the top-level domain. Example, adding the following to your hosts file: `127.0.0.1 example.test`
 - If you would like to control an entire top-level domain such as `.test` on your device, I'd recommend seeing this tutorial for DNSmasq [USE DNSMASQ INSTEAD OF /ETC/HOSTS](https://www.stevenrombauts.be/2018/01/use-dnsmasq-instead-of-etc-hosts/). This is heavyly geared toward macOS, but should work for most UNIX-like systems. Windows has alternatives.

***npm run build***  
 - This will build using webpack and the bundle.js file will be in /public/dist
 - Built from /src directory in both directories, client and server.

 ***npm test***  
 - Runs Jest testing suites
